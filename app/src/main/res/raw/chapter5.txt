Life is a matter of personal preference, and only you can decide what that preference is.

I did not write this book to tell people how to live their lives. In truth, I believe we already know exactly what to do, what is important to us, and what gets in our way.

I do however feel that we get sidetracked very easily; caught up in the stories we create that make our problems seem bigger than they really are. We're also good at making up conditions we tell ourselves we have to meet in order to achieve our goals: conditions that usually don't even really matter and do nothing more than keep us from moving forward.

Some of us have allowed ourselves to believe that we can't actually have what we want, so we settle for easy-to-achieve pleasures and successes instead. That is not to say that there is anything wrong with seeking pleasure and a feeling of accomplishment, but if you are doing it to avoid facing what you know you need to do next, then you might want to contemplate the reason behind your actions.

I wrote this book to remind people to put their focus back on what they truly know to be important to them. If you know what you want in life, then put your focus on it, and Keep it there!

If you get overwhelmed, take small steps. if you seize up with fear, take action and you will overcome it. You know exactly what you need to do, and if for some reason you feel that you do not; it is most likely because you don't believe you can actually have what you truly want for yourself.

If you took the time to answer these 3 powerful questions, then you are that much closer to living the life you desire. Whether you get that life depends on where you choose to put your focus and your attention, every minute of every day.

I hope that you choose to focus on what you love and truly desire in life, because only you can share your message and who you are with the world. Whatever you may choose, know that you will absolutely have an impact.
