As I lay in my soft, warm bed, sinking into the depths of my king-size mattress the faint scent of lavender drifts through the open window from the newly born morning air. I feel the heat of the sun on my face. Eyes still closed, I take a deep breath.

It's slow and labored, made worse by the passing of many long years. I know that it won't be long now and I prepare my mind for what my body has already accepted. I am dying and in an attempt to justify this new transition, my mind races back through time recalling all that I have done throughout my life.

What accomplishments did I achieve? What have I learned? How did I spend my time, and what held me back? Did I leave a legacy behind? Did I have an impact on the world; its' people, my friends, family? Did I have an impact on myself? These are the questions that pour through my head.

And the answers?...
