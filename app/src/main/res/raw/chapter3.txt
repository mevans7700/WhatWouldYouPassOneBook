What are some of your biggest fears and/or hurdles (current or conquered)?

"Fear is simply your subconscious pointing out where your biggest breakthroughs can be found."
-John, 45, Male, CA, USA

This question seems rather obvious, but it is absolutely crucial that you answer it if you want to make real changes in your life. The only reason we are not living our ideal lives right NOW, is because of fear. Fears are merely another type of belief, but one that comes with a strong emotional charge to it, and they are often under the surface and hard to detect. Fears can keep us from changing.

Change is a transfer of energy; it is a transition from one state of being to another. With every change you must let go of something in order to obtain something else. It is important to ask yourself what you must let go of in order to obtain that which you desire.

Your fear will either be attached to what you must lose, or it will come from what you are gaining. That may sound strange, but we do the same thing we have always done over and over because it is familiar; which means it is safe. Even though getting a new higher-paying job at your favorite company may sound like a dream come true, it is still new territory and unfamiliar ground: There will be new experiences you must face, and new experiences always bring the threat of discomfort.

Here are some of our biggest fears and hurdles in life: 

"What I do does not make a difference."
-Kay, 64, Female, WA, USA

"...My biggest fear is that I am frightened of dying with my music (gifts) still inside me, unrealized!"
-Lisa, 38, Female, Australia

"My biggest challenges are financial; I am deeply in debt with no assets, and no employment. What is also challenging is following my beliefs and acting on those beliefs consistently in order to climb back out of poverty."
-Elizabeth, 62, Female, WA, USA

"A year ago, without any warning, my husband of 30 years suddenly died from an aortic aneurysm... I am moving forward, as I know he would have wanted me to. I accept whatever comes to me and know that there is a divine plan and lesson for me to learn. I feel blessed to have had such a great man as my husband for 30 years!"
-Theresa, 56, Female, HI, USA

"My Fears Include: Death, injury, loss of loved ones, missed opportunities, not finding the love of my life, not taking advantage of my youth, not being good enough. Being different."
-Palmer, 24, Male, OR, USA

"I held my youngest son in my arms and watched him die, that was my biggest fear - losing a child: after that, all other fears paled in comparison and were greatly diminished. Once my greatest fear came to pass and I lived through it, I was no longer afraid to confront things in my life that needed to be confronted, to take risks, or to speak my mind and what's in my heart. Once you survive your own personal hell, what lies on the other side of your greatest fears can be truly liberating."
-Stephanie, 39, Female, ID, USA

Fears are important: They help us recognize potential threats, and situations that can be dangerous to us in physical, emotional, and psychological ways. Though they fulfill a fundamental role in our survival, fears (like beliefs) can be very irrational and are often based on nothing more than assumptions or false judgments.

When fear is our predominant operating program, we end up in a constant battle to remain in control of our environment and the people around us, in order to keep ourselves safe. The problem with "safe" is that you can't grow; growth comes from stepping out of playing it safe.

You must shine a bright light on your fears; become aware of them. Awareness dissolves fear so by recognizing that you are afraid you gain the power to take action; and it is in action that we find our footing again, so that we may keep moving forward.
