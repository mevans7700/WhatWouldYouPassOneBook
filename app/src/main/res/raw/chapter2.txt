What are a few of your most important beliefs and/or qualities about life, ones that you feel have served you or others well?

A belief is an agreement that you make with yourself that a statement is true, or that something exists.

The first question is about getting us to focus on what we believe is truly important. From the moment we are born, we are learning and absorbing new information all the time. This new information becomes the template and structure for how we live our lives. It is composed of billions if not trillions of beliefs (such as; I believe the sky is blue, that gravity exists, that I am a good person, or that I can't say no to alcohol).

Each person's template is unique, and it governs how they behave and interact with their environment and those around them. Beliefs are established through observation, and without beliefs of some kind, interaction of any kind would be impossible. So we need them, but the beliefs we have aren't always made up of perfect logic and reason. For example, one of my strongest beliefs that I acquired as a child is that I had to grow up in order to receive love.

"Why is any of this important?", you might ask. Because if our beliefs decide how we interact and behave in the world around us, then it makes sense that if we want to live happy and fulfilling lives, we need to have beliefs that support us in that desire.

Though we have a very large number of beliefs that direct our behavior in a number of different ways, some are more powerful than others. What makes one belief more powerful than another is your focus.

The first question is about discovering the beliefs that will guide you to living your ideal life, and then making those beliefs your greatest focus. Super-charge them with your attention and they will become the underlying foundation that directs your behavior.

Let's take a look at what some people believe by viewing some of the responses to question one...

"Too many of us are in auto-pilot; we are not alive, we are merely surviving. We allow ourselves to be dragged along and to get caught up in all kinds of situations, simply reacting, rather than to create our own experiences.  We need to recognize that everything that happens to us, every single person that we meet is Life giving us an opportunity to grow and become more of who we are: but we can only know this if we live consciously."
-Eliza, 48, Female, South Africa

"My mother-in-law has been my greatest teacher. She has taught me to not take things personally, and to stand up for myself. She has taught me to love as God loves, and that there is no one way to God."
-Greg, 51, Male, CA, USA

"The two most important pieces of advice I've been given are from my father: 'Embrace your choices,' and my grandfather: 'Life goes on.'"
-Rianna, 22, Female, IA, USA

"Be Amused! If we take ourselves and our world too seriously we all suffer in fear and depression. We all 'love' a good laugh, it makes us feel good. When we feel good, we are at our best, and when we are at our best we can  overcome all of life's challenges."
-Carl, 54, Male, OH, USA

"I believe that I am a physically and mentally healthier person when I get my mind off myself and focus on others."
-Eileen, 65, Female, FL, USA

"I would tell my kids to believe, trust and love themselves no matter what, and I would remind them that they each have a unique mission on this planet. I would ask them to keep chanting 'Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo' (Buddhist chant) so they can be absolutely happy, and so they can reveal the power within themselves to transform any obstacle into something beneficial."
-Tracy, 31, Female, AZ, USA

"All life simply is as it is, and it's all OK no matter what it looks like."
-Lesley, 57, Female, Australia

Each of these beliefs have the power to change our life in profound and magnificent ways. This is done through continually putting our focus and attention on them until they are not just clever sayings we heard or created, but they become statements that our body and our very essence live by.

It is likely that the people who wrote these truly believe in what they wrote, but it is also likely that they have many other beliefs in addition to these that counteract and contradict them. In order to reach the tipping point and create powerful change, our focus and energy would have to reside primarily on these beliefs. In this way energy is transferred away from the beliefs that no longer support us and towards the ones that do.

You can choose to believe in whatever you want, but know that you must believe in something, and that what you choose to believe in will absolutely transform your life, or keep you right where you are.
