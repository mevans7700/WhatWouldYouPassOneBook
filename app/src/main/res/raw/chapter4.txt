What do you believe to be the most powerful actions that someone can take in life; actions that will lead to fulfilling ones' dreams and living out whatever their ideal life may be?

It is important to be aware of your beliefs, but even more important is how you act on them.

Question 3 is very similar to question 1: It is  taking the principles and beliefs of the first question and rewriting them into action statements. That makes this question the most important question of all, because it helps you make the transition from thought to action, and it is in action that you will find powerful transformations unfolding in your life.

This question also helps give us a more generalized view on what action to take. However, we can only share what we ourselves have learned from our own life experience: Whatever your response may be, it will best be applied to your own life.

Here are some of the most powerful actions that we can take:

"Spend some time doing what you would be doing if all your dreams came true TODAY. Do activities that will help your physical, mental and spiritual well-being. Help someone else reach their goals."
-Svein, 40, Male, NY, USA

"Taking time for yourself, sit in a quiet space daily, listen, breathe often, and choose in favor of what is best for YOU at all times. Question your thoughts and beliefs. If they serve you, keep them; if not, let them go."
-Mary Lynne, 40, Female, CO, USA

"Everyone has a choice to do what they want to do with their lives. Don't be a victim. Don't blame others for the choices that you have made. Take control of your own life. Life is simple: A healthy body = a healthy mind. Balance your time between work, family, and fun! Do everything with Love... Give, and receive. Find a spiritual path that makes you happy!"
-Jade, 30, Female, South Africa

"Be genuine with everyone; try everything once; don't disrespect or devalue anything or anyone, especially yourself. Write down your thoughts and ideas when you have them: you may not understand their significance until a later time and then you can go back and review them when the situation arises. Don't prejudge; allow yourself to be surprised."
-Tammy, 44, Female, NM, USA


"I don't know... maybe maintaining consistent actions that are positive every day and not falling back into negative feelings and thoughts."
-Elizabeth, 62, Female, WA,USA

"The most powerful actions that will bring total joy and glory are loving others as He loves us, serving those in need, forgiveness, faith, and doing our best to follow the example of Christ while he walked this earth."
-Sheri, 51, Female, TX, USA

"Loving themselves unconditionally. It sounds cliché, but that is the number one thing we all strive for. When we love ourselves, we feel happy; we are connected spiritually to our higher power; we see the light in everyone and everything around us; we acknowledge our own light."
-Marie, 42, Female, ME, USA

"Find a lane and go. If you find it's the wrong lane, or the wrong direction, switch lanes or change direction, but GO!"
-Datta, Over 20, Male, CO, USA

"I believe your thoughts become things, however I think that people take that a little to literally and forget about the 'Oh yeah! I need to do something' part.  Dreaming about what you want is the first step, and the feeling you get from believing in that dream will drive your determination to do what needs to be done. I think the most important action is the belief itself, because that is where you get the drive."
-Jaylene, 33, Female, Canada
